I am a Doctoral Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/index.php/Departments/dept_cse)


# Research Interests
I broadly work in Big data analytics and its application in the field of [precision agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/precision-agriculture), that is, analyzing the data and building models to ensure that crops and soil receive exactly what they need for optimum health and productivity. The problems that are addressed in my research work so far are:-
 - Crop recommendation system, using the Naive Bayes algorithm, to find the best time of sowing and ideal crop for plantation based on environmental parameters and predict the expected harvest.
 - Adaboost.RT-based N-P-K prediction to decide required soil NPK content using one-time soil testing like accessible soil contents, type of soil, crop, and yield target. 
 - Discussing the core concept of Machine learning and systematic processes to comprehend its application in agriculture. 
 - An efficient DBSCAN based model to find and treat the cotton plant affected by Xanthomonas mavacearum and identify the soil areas affected by an overuse of the pesticides. 
 - Modular artificial neural network-based crop yield prediction by considering weather attributes and land and suggesting measures to increase the crop yield.
